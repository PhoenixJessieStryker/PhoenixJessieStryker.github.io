                                        <p>As you can probably see by the dramatic photo of me lookign off into the distance of the wellington harbour...*notice*... I love Adventure<br>
                                        Trying new things and exploring runs in my blood and finding new ideas and meeting new people is always exciting. I wasnt always this way though..<br>
                                        I never used to step outside my comfort zone and i always had regrets for that later on or shortly after when seeing how much fun it could have been. <br>
                                              Have you ever felt that way?
