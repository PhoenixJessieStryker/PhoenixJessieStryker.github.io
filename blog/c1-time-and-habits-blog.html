    <h3><U>what did you find interesting?</U></h3>
    <p>Overall the Majority were very eye opening but the two that really spoke to me where both A & B and ive really managed to make a few changes in my life starting today because of what ive learned. Whether it was taking what Carol Dwell had to say or using the counterintuitive tips in my own crazy but different way to learn 
      to learn.
    </p>
    <h3><u>what worked for you?</u></h3>
    <p>
    All of the above really, However 'Flow' really matched with the way i characterised my everyday life. It was just something i had never really thought of and made me wonder if it may encourage others to be immersed and motivated by mine or others reflected behaviour..
 
  </p>
  <h3><u>which will you experiment further with?</u></h3>  
    <p>
     I believe i'll work on both my mindset and the way i approach challenges. I feel soemtimes im not always at my best and begin to let my mind wonder or day dream. Using what ive learnt i might be able to make some changes in my lifestyle..
