                 <div class="col-4"> <h3>What is a responsive site?, and why is responsiveness important?.</h3>
                    <p>A responsive site allows visitors to access your site from a wide range of devices without the layout becoming distorted.
                    <p>This includes Smartphones, Tablets, Consoles,Tv's and the likes.. The site will react to the size of the screen it is being displayed on then adjust the layout appropriately. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>The content of the site will be the same or similar. On a smaller screen.
                        For example a mobile phone, we may be able to remove unnecessary items like pictures or as you see on other websites 'advetisements' often disapear once the site is viewed from a mobile device.
                        It's safe to say we can assume that with smaller screens people need a quick and easy to read amount information. We assume that the site is less about the extras and touch up's and instead more about information in a quick and legible small page. 
                        We Acknowledge can Acknowledge that with Bigger screens, people have more time to take in some added finishing touches. Taking out extra's on the smaller screens will mean the site load's alot more quickly especially in bad receptive areas...
                    </p>

                 </div>
                 <div class="col-4"><h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important. </h3>

                    
                    <p>Mobile first design is creating your website to fit a small device's such as a mbile phone and then expanding the site from there.
                         You first make sure your website is suitable to a small screen and as the screen size increases you can use the negative space that created for more features.Such as Images and the Likes. 
                         Creating a site to fit a small screen is generally harder because you may be trying to fit a lot of information into a compacted space.. so its almost as though you are creating the hardest bit first then adding from there. 
                         this may not apply to everyone though as you might find that a mobile device displays your website exactly how you want it but find it hard when you have to fill in the webpage the bigger it gets..
                         Its important because it can keep consistency over the screen sizes. It also saves creating a whole new website for a mobile...and well with what i know ,i think resizing is the shortcut...

                 <div class="col-4"><h3>What are frameworks , and what are their pros and cons?</h3>
                    <p>Frameworks are essentially auto styling for your website they contain the Structure of file's and folders of standardized code.
                       In short - the frameworks creates other CSS pages which you can link to. 
                       They store premade Styling which is then applied to your website. Using classes around the grid based system gives you a nice layout, the headings will be consistent over all pages that link to the same framework.
                       Pros are everything looks the some over all of you'r pages. The design all works together from picture formatting to headings and boarders. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The cons are there isn’t a lot or options. Their aren’t as many options as if you created the CSS from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p> keep in mind that if you ever just want one singular page or many others to be different styles or possibly even mix them then you can.
                       you have the choice to either make an individual style file as i like to call it or mayeb just list the changes in your websites code (Both options could get messy or even cluttered but that all depends on hwo big your website is and how many changes your making..)

                <div class="col-4"> <h3>What is a wireframe and why is it we use it?</h3>
                    <p> Wireframe is essentially sketching the basic layout of your website before you start writing any code.</p>
                    <p>The Sketch can be on any platform or show on paper as you'll see i've done below with a sharpie and paper.</p>
                    <p> It is a mock up or plan of what you are going to try to achieve. We use it as a first step to creating a new page. 
                         In practical terms it's a visual plan of what we (you) are hoping to create.
